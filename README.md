# MACDILMECH
Kinetic mechanisms for the oxidation of toluene reference fuel with ethanol addition (TRFE). Funded by the ANR project MACDIL.

## MACDIL-DTL
The **detialed** mechanism, containing **2332** species and **9900** reactions (by Mar. 9th 2020).

## MACDIL-RDC
The **semi-detailed** mechanism suitable for 1D flame speed calculations, containing **1026** species and **5388** reactions (by Mar. 9th 2020).

## MACDIL-RDC+
A **semi-detailed** mechanism (598 species, 3726 reactions), which is ***samller*** than MACDIL-RDC. It is reduced from MACDIL-DTL (commit: 4663e84) and the reduction details can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/fae97c256d3e49ea91030520b6b706af?v=da41e6ba28ff4bee81567792df43f874).
